# A-B-testing
This project analyzes marketing A/B test data to evaluate the impact of different test groups (ad vs. PSA) on conversions. It includes visualizing distributions, calculating conversion rates by group, day, and hour, and performing statistical tests (Chi-Square, T-Test, Mann-Whitney U) to assess significance.
