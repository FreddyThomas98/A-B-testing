# A-B-testing
This project focuses on analyzing marketing A/B test data to evaluate the impact of different test groups (ad vs. PSA) on user conversions. The analysis includes:

Data Exploration: Loading and understanding the dataset.
Categorical Variable Analysis: Visualizing distributions of test groups, conversion status, most ads day, and most ads hour using count plots and pie charts.
Numerical Variable Analysis: Analyzing the total ads variable with histograms and box plots to understand its distribution.
Conversion Rate Analysis: Calculating and visualizing conversion rates by test group, most ads day, and most ads hour using bar charts.
Statistical Tests: Performing Chi-Square tests to determine associations between categorical variables and conversion status, and using T-Tests or Mann-Whitney U tests to compare most ads hour distributions between converted and non-converted users.
The goal is to identify significant differences in conversion rates and provide insights to optimize future marketing campaigns.
